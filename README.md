# PATH-VISUALIZER
A pyqt tool to visualize path finding algorithms.

## Installation 
 Clone the directory
 
 Go to the terminal
 
 Type python main.py to run

## Algorithms supported by the tool
#### Uninformed search
**Breath-first Search (unweighted)**: a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

**Depth-first Search (unweighted)**: a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path

**Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted)**: the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

#### Informed search

**A * Search (weighted)**: arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Greedy Best-first Search (weighted)**: a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path
